			<h1>About Kittiwake Border Morris</h1>
			<p>This website is under construction, please check back later.</p>
			<p>Kittiwake Border Morris are a heady mix of energy, youth, sticks and joy! Swooping into formation in Bristol in 2022, we perform a mixture of original and traditional dances accompanied by a fantastic band of talented musicians - seamlessly blending the best of tradition with fresh innovation. We are a proudly LGBTQ+ inclusive side, with a diverse range of members. Our blue, white and black tatters and feather-style faces (representing their seabird moniker), youthful energy and plenty of stick clashing make for performances that are both fun and fierce. Come along to one of our events for a mesmerising show full of yips, yells and bells!</p>
